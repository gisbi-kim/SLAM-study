        Good review:
            07 JFR 6D SLAMâ€”3D Mapping Outdoor Environments
        09 Zebedee:
            TYPE:
                feature to feature 
            09 Continuous 3d scan-matching with a spinning 2d laser
            build a voxel grid 
            each voxel compute shapes to keep only cylindrical and planar areas for matching
        11 Velodyne SLAM:
            TYPE: 
                scan to model 
            de-skew the range image along the trajectory 
            Map:
                build a map as a 3D grid structure containing small surfaces
            Matching:
                de-skewed LiDAR scan is localized with respect to that map
        15 Pose interpolation slam for large maps using moving 3d sensors
            TYPE: 
                scan to model 
            Map:
                sparse voxelized representation of the map
            Matching:
                ICP
        17 LOAM
            TYPE:
                feature to feature:
                    edges and planar features
                scan to model 
            Map:
                edge line 
                planar surface 
            Matching:
                edge feature <-> edge line 
                plane feature <-> planar surface
